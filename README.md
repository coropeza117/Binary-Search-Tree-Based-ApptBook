# Binary-Search-Tree-Based-ApptBook

-Accomplishments

• Efficient Data Structure

The primary accomplishment of this project is the implementation of an efficient data structure for managing appointments. By utilizing a binary search tree (BST), this data structure offers improved insertion and lookup mechanisms compared to traditional arrays or linked lists. This efficiency is especially crucial when handling a large number of appointments.

• Handling Duplicates

The ApptBook ADT implemented in this project handles duplicate appointments gracefully. When a duplicate appointment is added, it appears in the right subtree of any existing equivalent appointments, ensuring that all entries are appropriately managed.

• Cursor Management

This project introduces cursor management, allowing users to navigate through the appointments efficiently. The cursor starts at the first element in the binary tree, making it easy to iterate through the appointments in a sorted order. Advanced cursor management techniques have been implemented to handle various cases.

• Helper Methods

The project includes a set of well-documented helper methods that aid in checking the integrity of the binary search tree. These methods verify that the tree is height-bounded, count nodes, and ensure that elements are correctly placed within the tree. These helpers significantly contribute to the reliability of the data structure.

• Robust Testing

A comprehensive suite of tests has been included in the project to verify the correctness of the ApptBook ADT and its helper methods. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that the data structure functions as expected.

• Future Development

While the project has successfully met its objectives, there is room for future development and enhancement. Some potential areas for improvement and expansion include:

    Implementation of the removeCurrent operation in the ApptBook ADT.
    Enhancing the user interface for interacting with the appointment book, including user-friendly input and output.
    Further optimizations to the binary search tree structure, such as implementing self-balancing techniques for handling unbalanced trees.
